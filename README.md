P2P FILE TRANSFER 
----------------------------------

Overview:
---------
This project implements a basic peer-to-peer file transfer application in C, using the Windows Sockets (Winsock) API. 
Each peer can both listen for inbound connections (from other peers) and optionally connect to another peerâ€™s IP and port. 
When connected, peers exchange files in both directions.

Features:
---------
1. Peer-to-Peer Communication:
   - Each instance can listen on a specified port for incoming connections.
   - It can also connect to a specified IP and port to initiate file transfer.

2. File Transfer:
   - If you provide a filename argument, the peer will send that file to the connected peer.
   - The peer also receives files from the other peer and saves them.

3. Usage:
   - Start one peer in "listening only" mode (no IP/port arguments).
   - Start another peer specifying the IP and port of the first peer, plus a filename to send.
   - They exchange files in both directions.
